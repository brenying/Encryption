# Encryption Program

## Objective
This project implements a Java-based encryption and decryption tool that allows users to enter a custom cipher, encrypt plaintext into hexadecimal form, and decrypt previously encoded messages. It serves as a hands-on demonstration of input validation, ASCII manipulation, and fundamental cryptographic concepts.

### Skills Learned
- Understanding and applying SIEM-like structured logging logic within a console program.
- Handling user input and validation using Java’s Scanner class.
- Manipulating ASCII values to perform encryption/decryption.
- Converting characters to hexadecimal and back using Java built-in functions.
- Designing clear control flow with loops, conditionals, and switch statements.
- Building interactive console-based applications.

### Tools Used
- Java (JDK)
- Scanner for input processing
- Integer/Hexadecimal conversion utilities
- Console interface for user interaction
